IP-Ranges
#########

List
****

*FiFo* manages all IP provisioning. It stores a pool of IP addresses for each network you create. Upon machine creation *FiFo* assigns IP addresses, when a machine is destroyed it returns the IP addresses to the pool. The address assignment works in conjunction with the security features built into *SmartOS* to ensure that only the IP address handed out can be used on the specific network you deploy on. This ensures a good neighbor policy; it prevents malicious users of machines from spoofing IP addresses and interfering with the traffic of other machines.

The default network list view shows the networks that are currently configured and columns with information specific to each network:

- **Name**: You can chose any name you like.
- **Tag**: The network **Tag** must be a real network tag that exists on at least one hypervisor/compute node.
- **Network**: The network address of your network.
- **Netmask**: The subnet mask of your network.
- **Gateway**: The network gateway.
- **First**: The first provision-able IP address in the range.
- **Last**: The last provision-able IP address in the range.
- **Next**: The next IP address that will be handed out.
- **VLAN**: The network VLAN ID (optional).
- **Returned**: The number of addresses that have been returned to the pool.
- **Action**: Delete the network by clicking on the **X** delete icon.

Create
******

To create a new network click on the |add network| button: 

.. |add network| image:: /_static/images/jingles/ipranges-add.png

.. image:: /_static/images/jingles/ipranges02.png

Populate the fields with network information relevant to the network you want to setup. The system will only allow you to select a valid network **Tag** that does in fact exist on one or more hypervisor/compute nodes.

Enter the **first** and **last** IP address in the range that you want *FiFo* to allocate.

When all required fields are filled in, the |create| button will appear.

Click on the |create| button to save your new network:
