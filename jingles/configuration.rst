Configuration
*************

The Jingles configuration file is stored in ``/opt/local/fifo-jingles/dist/scripts/config.js``. It's a JSON file with configuration values. It is copied during the first installation and cannot be overwritten, however the newest configuration can always be found under ``/opt/local/fifo-jingles/dist/scripts/config.js.example``. In this config file you can set the remote dataset server source and thresholds for dashboard alerts and timeout values.

.. note::
	
	Please see the in-line comments within the file on how to make setting changes.
