.. note::
	
	Right now FiFo only supports running scripts that output `lquantize`.

Adding a new script is rather simple. It is a plain D-Trace script, however there is an expectation since the script runs on multiple servers and needs to be configurable. Variables are encased in ``$`` signs and can be chosen freely. The only exception is the special placeholder: ``$filter$``. It is the filter created to match the system it is supposed to run on.

	1. Enter the name of the new script.
	2. Enter the code of the script with the variables.
	3. Enter variables needed ahead of time.
	4. By clicking the |create button| button you can create the new DTrace.

Details

The details view lets you see the script in it's raw form and the default variables it has. However it can not be changed.

This section allows you to run a D-Trace script either against individual VM's or Servers. If a VM is selected there is no need to select the servers they are on, FiFo will calculate that automatically.

	1. The Server to run upon.
	2. The VM's to run against.
	3. This section will show a heatmap of the output.
	4. The variables to run the script with, this can be adjusted to fit the current use case.
