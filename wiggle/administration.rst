**************
Administration
**************

The `Wiggle <../wiggle.html>`_ admin command is ``wiggle-admin``.

General management
##################

`Wiggle <../wiggle.html>`_ uses the SMF to manage its running state so it is restarted in the case of crashes and booted accordingly on system start. `Wiggle <../wiggle.html>`_ can be enabled, disabled and restarted via: ``svcadm enable wiggle``, ``svcadm disable wiggle`` and ``svcadm restart wiggle``

Updating
********

`Wiggle <../wiggle.html>`_ can be updated by three simple steps.

1. Installing the new package
*****************************

.. code-block:: bash

   pkgin -fy update
   pkgin -fy install fifo-wiggle

2. Updating the config
**********************

After the newest package is installed the config file should be checked for changes and edited if needed. The ``.example`` file will always contain the newest version of the config. ``diff`` is a handy tool to see if some settings need to be added to the existing file.

.. code-block:: bash

   diff /opt/loca/fifo-wiggle/etc/wiggle.conf /opt/local/fifo-wiggle/etc/wiggle.conf.example
   vi /opt/local/fifo-wiggle/etc/wiggle.conf


3. Restarting the service
*************************
After the config is updated the service needs to be restarted. If `Wiggle <../wiggle.html>`_ is running in a clustered configuration and has more then ``N`` nodes it is often possible to do a rolling update by restarting one by one.
